* Planned Modules

** ODE
   solvers for differential equation
   
** Geometry
   Geometric shapes, curves

   meshes might be in a separate module

** SolversAndOptimizers
   module containing various equation solvers or minimizers like Newton Solver or gradient descent

   bindings to Cvx/CvxLean
   
** NumericalIntegration
   solving integrals
   
** Interpolation  '
   interpolating function on intervals, grids, etc.

** FiniteElement
   
** Symbolic
   Runtime symbolic polynomials, differential forms and geometric algebra

** Eigen
   Bindings to eigen

** Cuda
   Bindings to cuda libraries and probably some kind of kernel compiler

** MaterialPointMethod
   material point method
   - grit to point and point to grid transfers

** DEC
   Discrete exterior calculus
   - discrete differential forms
   - co-tan laplacian

** ClassicalMechanics
   - Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
   - motion of rigid bodies

** DDG
  - Discrete differential geometry.
  - Surface Mesh.
  - Tree/Cotree algorithm to compute homology.
  - Sparse Laplacian construction for geodesics, parallel transport.
